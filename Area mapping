## Area mapping between *State and Metro Employment* and *CPI-W* Dataset
Currently, geographic areas defined by Employment and CPI dataset are differenct. By and large, Employment dataset covers metro areas more detailed while CPI data are realeased with only a few metro areas (self-representing areas). This was made to map this discrepancy for my own purposes. In fact, BLS is in the process of changing geographic areas with adding mid-sized areas and shifting from size-based to area-based one (e.g., New England, South Atlantic).
**Core** in below table means self-representing areas (size class A).
