The following is a definition of:  STATE AND AREA EMPLOYMENT, HOURS AND EARNINGS (SM)

Survey Description:  The Current Employment Statistics survey, as a joint 
Federal-State undertaking, generates State and area, as well as national, 
statistics on employment, hours, and earnings.

BLS collects data each month from a sample of establishments in 
all nonagricultural industries including government.  From these data, a 
large number of series on employment, hours, and earnings in considerable 
industrial detail are published monthly for each of the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

Those industries which reflect significant economic activities are selected
for publication.

All employment, hours, and earnings series, State and area as well as 
national, are classified according to the 2012 North American Industrial 
Classification System (NAICS).

Summary Data Available:  For total payroll employment, nearly 19,000 series of
monthly data are available; they cover each State and about 450 major 
labor areas, most of which are Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Estimates 
for the total nonfarm series will begin in 1939. In most cases, other industry series   
will start with January 1990. 

In the largest States, up to 300 industries are reported.

Expanded Supersector data is available for all States and MSAs.  Most States also have 
detail at the NAICS sector level.  Some industry detail is available at the 4-digit, 
5-digit, and 6-digit NAICS level.

Frequency of Observations:  All data are monthly.

Annual Averages:  Annual averages are available.

Data Characteristics:  Employment is measured in thousands of workers and is
stored with one decimal place.  Earnings are measured in dollars and are 
stored with two decimal places.  Average weekly hours are measured in hours 
and are stored with one decimal place.

Updating Schedule:  Updates are usually available 10 to 12 weeks following 
the survey week (the week containing the 12th) in the reference month.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time

over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 

is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The FTP files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
sm.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)

The series_id (SMU01266207072200001) can be broken out into:

Code					Value

state_code		=		01
area_code		=		26620
supersector_code	=		70

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are 
separated by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

The sm.data file is partitioned into a number of separate files:  See Section 2

The above-referenced data files have the following format:
